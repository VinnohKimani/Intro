Learning  Intro to git

To initialize git -->git init (we only do this once)
To check a file command/file status -->git status
To track a single file/directory --> git add(file/directory name)
To track all files --> git add
Command to commit files/ direcrory --> git commit -m(commit message)
To verify creation of repo --> git remote -verify
To push code to online repo --> git push -u main/master

Hope this helps
Thank you.

Just realised that the above information is not that clear
on adding a repository

To initialize git -->git init (we only do this once)
To check a file command/file status -->git status
To track a single file/directory --> git add(file/directory name)
To track all files --> git add
Command to commit files/ direcrory --> git commit -m(commit message)

To enter repo name --> git remote add origin(Link you coppied from Github)
To verify creation of repo --> git remote -v
Check status--> git status
To push code to online repo --> git push -u main/master

while trying to add changes to .txt file I encountered some challenges
but worry no more I got you

To add changes to repo file --> git add(name of file)
To commit-->git commit (description)
To add origin --> git remote add origin (SSH link of repo)
To check status --> git status
To push updates to repo --> git push
