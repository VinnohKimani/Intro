Earlier on today's class I was not understanding espessially
in the first moments. I glad that I have already catched up.
I have not connected my vs code to git but I will definetly do it 
immediately after class.

To intialize git ---> git init (we only do this once)
To check a file command is -->git status
To track a single file/ directory --> git add (file name/directory)
To track all files --> git add
Command to commit files/ directory --> git commit -m(commit message)
